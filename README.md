# 🐶🐱 Dogs vs. Cats Classification using Transfer Learning  
**Deep Learning | CNN | Transfer Learning | TensorFlow | Keras**

## 📖 Overview  
This project classifies images of dogs and cats using **Transfer Learning** with a pre-trained **CNN model**. The goal is to leverage a **deep learning model** trained on ImageNet and fine-tune it for binary classification (Dog vs. Cat).

---

## 🗂️ Dataset  
The dataset consists of labeled images of dogs and cats.  

- **Class 0**: Cat  
- **Class 1**: Dog  

*(Ensure dataset structure follows standard train/test split.)*

## 🛠️ Methodology  

### 🔹 Data Preprocessing  
- Resized images to **224x224** for CNN compatibility  
- Normalized pixel values (scaled between `[0,1]`)  
- Used **data augmentation** (`ImageDataGenerator`) to improve generalization  

### 🔹 Model Architecture  
- Utilized a **pre-trained CNN model** (e.g., `VGG16`, `ResNet50`, `InceptionV3`)  
- Removed top layers and added a **custom classifier**  
- Fine-tuned top layers for domain-specific learning  

### 🔹 Training  
- Loss Function: `binary_crossentropy`  
- Optimizer: `Adam`  
- Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score  

### 🔹 Visualization  
- Plotted training vs. validation accuracy and loss  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Sample predictions

## 📊 Results  
- Achieved **high accuracy** on validation/test data  
- Successfully differentiated between dogs and cats  
- Transfer learning significantly improved performance
